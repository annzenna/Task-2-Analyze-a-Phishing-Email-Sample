# Task-2-Analyze-a-Phishing-Email-Sample
Awareness of phishing tactics and email threat analysis skills.

Step 1: A Sample Phishing Email.

    From: support@msupdate.net
    Subject: Microsoft account password change
        
    Your pasword was changed. If this wasn't you, click the link below to reset it: [Reset Password]
    (http://reset-microsoft-login.com)
    
    Thanks,
    Microsoft Team

 Step 2: Look at the Sender's Email Address

 Click on the name of the sender to see the full email address.

     support@msupdate.net
     
 Step 3: Check the Email Header (optional/extra credit) 
 
    In real email, we can check in the three dots shown in email window with show original then click on copy clip board/ Download Original option. Then using online header analyzer we can analyze the report.
 
Step 4: Analysis Report of Sample Phishing Email

    Sender Address:support@msupdate.net  
    But it is not a real Microsoft domain.

    Subject: Microsoft account password change  
    Creates urgency by implying the account may be compromised.

    Suspicious Link: http://reset-microsoft-login.com
    It is not an official Microsoft website.

Step 5: Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.

    Language:"If this wasn't you, click the link below" – tries to create fear.

 Step 6: Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link).

    The actual link is hidden behind text – real destination is unknown until hovered or clicked

 Step 7: Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors.

     Your pasword was changed
 
 Step 8: Summarize phishing traits found in the email

     Fake sender address          : Email is from support@msupdate.net, not a real Microsoft doma
     Suspicious links	            : Link likely goes to a fake site (not a Microsoft domain)
     Urgent language	            : Message says “If this wasn’t you…” – creates fear to make you click quickly
     Lack of branding or logo     : No Microsoft logo or branding elements present in the email
     Unusual domain name	        : Uses msupdate.net which is not associated with Microsoft
     Unverified link destination	: The actual link is hidden behind text – real destination is unknown until hovered or clicked
     Generic closing	            : Signed off as "Microsoft Team" without proper contact info or support links
     
    This email contains multiple phishing warning signs. The combination of a fake sender, scare tactics, and misleading links strongly suggests it's a phishing attempt. It should not be trusted or interacted with.
